After getting the source code, the first thing you should do, is to install the Pods.
New to CocoaPods? Install CocoaPods at [cocoapods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

Switch into the project root and install the Pods.

        pod install

When the Pods are successfully installed, use only the *.xcworkspace to open the project in Xcode.
Now you are ready to run the project.
