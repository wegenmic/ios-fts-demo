ownCloud gives you universal access to your files through a web interface or WebDAV.
It also provides a platform to easily view & sync your contacts, calendars and bookmarks across all your devices and enables basic editing right on the web.
Installation has minimal server requirements, doesnâ€™t need special permissions and is quick.
ownCloud is extendable via a simple but powerful API for applications and plugins.
